📰 News Text Classification Pipeline

live deployed link: https://newsclassification-uteurydj7da8jwe25frsyl.streamlit.app/

An end-to-end NLP machine learning pipeline for classifying news articles into categories using TF-IDF vectorization and Linear Support Vector Machine (LinearSVC).

This project demonstrates a clean, modular, and production-style ML workflow including preprocessing, feature engineering, training, evaluation, and configuration management.

🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a scalable and reproducible text classification system using the AG News Dataset.

The pipeline processes raw news data and classifies each article into its respective category using traditional NLP and machine learning techniques.

This project emphasizes:

Clean architecture
Modular design
Reproducibility
Maintainability
Clear ML workflow separation
🧠 Problem Statement

Given a dataset containing news articles with titles and descriptions, classify each article into one of multiple predefined categories.

This is a multi-class text classification problem.

🏗️ Project Architecture
The system follows a structured ML pipeline:

Raw Dataset ↓ Data Preprocessing ↓ Cleaned Dataset ↓ TF-IDF Feature Engineering ↓ Train/Test Split (Stratified) ↓ Model Training (Linear SVM) ↓ Model Serialization ↓ Model Evaluation ↓ Metrics Storage

Each stage is modular and separated into dedicated files for maintainability.

🔁 Workflow Explanation

1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
File: data_preprocessing.py

Load raw dataset
Combine Title and Description
Convert text to lowercase
Remove special characters using regex
Remove English stopwords (NLTK)
Save cleaned dataset
Output: data/processed/cleaned.csv

2️⃣ Feature Engineering
File: feature_engineering.py

Load cleaned dataset
Separate features and labels
Convert text into numerical vectors using TF-IDF
Limit vocabulary to 5000 features
Perform stratified train-test split
Ensure reproducibility using random_state
Why TF-IDF?

Reduces impact of common words
Improves discriminative power
Works efficiently with linear models

3️⃣ Model Training
File: train.py

Model used: LinearSVC (Support Vector Machine)

Why Linear SVM?

Performs well on high-dimensional sparse data
Fast and memory efficient
Strong generalization for text classification
The following artifacts are saved using joblib:

Trained model
Fitted TF-IDF vectorizer
Test dataset
Output: models/news_classifier.pkl

4️⃣ Model Evaluation
File: evaluate.py

Metrics calculated:

Accuracy
Confusion Matrix
Precision
Recall
F1-Score
Results are stored in:
